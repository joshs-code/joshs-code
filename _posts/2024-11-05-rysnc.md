# Rsync and Backups

Install Rsync

```
sudo yum install rysnc -y
```

Make a backup dir:

```
mkdir /backup
```

Run the rsync command: 

Make sure to use the / after the directory names if you want to save directly and not create a folder within the backup. Rsync only transfers files that have been modified.

```
rsync -r <source>/ <location to backup>/ # Copies all files and directories
rysnc -zr <source>/ <location to backup>/ # This compresses
rysnc -zvr <source>/ <location to backup>/ # This is compresses and verbose
rysnc -avz <source>/ <location to backup>/ # This will perserve ownsership and permissions and timestamp

example: rsync -r /projects/ /backup/
```

Rsync to another machine:

```
rsync -r <source>/ ip:~/home/backup

example: rsync /projects/ 192.168.12.100:~/home/backup
```

Reverse 

```
rysnc -r ip:~/home/backup <source>
```
